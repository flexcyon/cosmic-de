This is a [Cosmic DE](https://system76.com/cosmic) port of the Obsidian.md theme
Flexcyon. It combines the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.
> It pairs decently well with the Iceberg Dark colour scheme.

### Why I made the theme

> I really liked the vibrant colours of the
> [Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky
> aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Hence,
> I decided to combine the two which started this theme.
